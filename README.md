# Parallel and Distributed Computing

This repo includes the work developed in the Parallel and Distributed Computing class @ FEUP, including two distinct assignments detailed below.

## Assignment 1

This project aimed to measure processor performance and relate it to memory accesses when dealing with large amounts of data.
To do this, we will use the Performance API (PAPI) to collect relevant project data.
The program used to gather information is a calculation of the product of two matrices.
Please check out the full report [here](assign1/doc/report.pdf).

## Assignment 2

> You were just hired for an internet online game company and your first task is to create a client-server system using TCP sockets in Java. The company has users that can authenticate with the system in order to play some text-based games among them. A class handles a game and requires a given number of connected players to start.

For this project, we created a simple game including its client and server, that can handle the simultaneous players simultaneously.
For more information, please read the [description](assign2/README.md).
