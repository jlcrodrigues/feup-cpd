### Steps to run

TODO

### Features

- [x] Auth: User information kept in file, allowing for registering, logging in and logging out.

- [ ] Game: Players can play the game, with the server keeping track of the game state.
- [ ] Ranking: Games will affect player rank.
- [ ] Client fault tolerance: Client can recover from client crashes.
- [ ] Server fault tolerance: Server can recover from server crashes.
- [x] Thread safety
- [ ] Client timeout to avoid slow clients
- [ ] Server side logger to keep track of events
- [x] No thread overheads: Server maintains a thread pool

### Protocol

To enable client-server communication we devised a simple TCP protocol, as described in [doc/Protocol.md](doc/Protocol.md).

### Project Structure

#### Server

On its main server, the Server will be dealing two types of connections:
 - Accepting new clients
 - Reading from idle sockets

Moreover, a thread will be requested and redirect execution to deal with the request.

#### Client

Client's program is composed of a state machine that will iterate through the different stages of the game.
The client acts as a proxy between user and server. 
It will read user input and communicate with the server using the specified protocol.
